        <h3 class="about-head">About</h3><br>
        <p>Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla was born in July of 1856, in what is now Croatia. He came to the
            United States in 1884, and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several
            patent rights, including those to his alternating-current machinery, to George Westinghouse. His 1891
            invention, the "Tesla coil," is still used in radio technology today. Tesla died in New York City on January
            7, 1943.</p>

        <h3>Famed Inventor</h3><br>
        <p>Tesla came to the United States in 1884, and soon began working with famed inventor and business mogul Thomas
            Edison. The two worked together for a brief period before parting ways due to a conflicting
            business-scientific relationship, attributed by historians to their incredibly different personalities:
            While Edison was a power figure who focused on marketing and financial success, Tesla was a commercially
            out-of-tune and somewhat vulnerable, yet extremely pivotal inventor, who pioneered some of history's most
            important inventions. His inventions include the "Tesla coil," developed in 1891, and an alternating-current
            electrical system of generators, motors and transformers—both of which are still used widely today.</p>

                    <summary>Alternating Current</summary>
                    <p>Tesla didn’t exactly invent Alternating Current (AC), but the he was the man who made AC
                        practical and usable for the entire planet. It wasn’t until wealthy investor George Westinghouse
                        got behind him that Tesla’s work on AC began to be taken seriously, and the AC/DC wars were on.

                    <p>The Tesla Coil is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency electricity. it was a
                        contraption that created flying arcs of electrical energy. </p>

                    <summary>Remote Control</summary>
                    <p>Tesla was awarded a patent for remote control in 1898, after using a battery-powered boat as a
                        demonstration. Years passed before the technology was used in any meaningful way.</p>

                    <summary>Radio</summary>
                    <p>The credit for inventing the radio initially went to Italian engineer Guglielmo Marconi, but it
                        was later revealed that Tesla had come up with the invention first. Tesla had two radio patents
                        accepted in the late 19th century, but the financial clout of Marconi’s backers saw the Italian
                        awarded the patent that mattered. </p>

                    <summary>Violet ray</summary>
                    <p>It may be obsolete today, but at the beginning of the 20th century electrotherapy was all the
                        rage, if ‘all the rage’ is an acceptable thing to say about revolutionary medicine. People soon
                        grew tired of having electric currents thrust through their bodies,He introduced it at the
                        Chicago’s World Fair in 1893, the same event in which he presented his famous Egg of Columbus.

                    <summary>Neon lamp</summary>
                    <p>Tesla didn’t invent neon lights themselves, but it was his wireless lighting work that led to
                        their creation.</p>

                    <summary>Shadowgraph</summary>
                    <p>X-ray is another invention that is credited to someone else but came about thanks in no small
                        part to the genius of Nikola Tesla. It was some throwaway experiments with discharge tubes
                        (proof itself that Tesla was no ordinary chap) that led to the discovery when Nikola noticed
                        that photographic plates nearby were damaged as a result of his noodling. Two years later Tesla
                        produced some of the first images of the human body using X-rays, which he referred to as
                        ‘Shadowgraphs’.</p>
